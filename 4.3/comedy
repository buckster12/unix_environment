First Merchant

    Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,
    Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
    This very day a Syracusian merchant
    Is apprehended for arrival here;
    And not being able to buy out his life
    According to the statute of the town,
    Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
    There is your money that I had to keep.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
    And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
    Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
    Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
    Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
    And then return and sleep within mine inn,
    For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
    Get thee away.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Many a man would take you at your word,
    And go indeed, having so good a mean.

    Exit
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
    When I am dull with care and melancholy,
    Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
    What, will you walk with me about the town,
    And then go to my inn and dine with me?

First Merchant

    I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
    Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
    I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
    Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
    And afterward consort you till bed-time:
    My present business calls me from you now.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
    And wander up and down to view the city.

First Merchant

    Sir, I commend you to your own content.

    Exit
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    He that commends me to mine own content
    Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
    I to the world am like a drop of water
    That in the ocean seeks another drop,
    Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
    Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
    So I, to find a mother and a brother,
    In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.

    Enter DROMIO of Ephesus
    Here comes the almanac of my true date.
    What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
